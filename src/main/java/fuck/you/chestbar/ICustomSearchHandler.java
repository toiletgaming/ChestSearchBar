	 * have been run (item name, enchantments, mod name, etc)<br><br>
	 * 
	 * The <b>search</b> parameter is a function pointer to the method that called this one. This allows
	 * for recursive searching, which can be used for say, backpack style items. 
	 * For example, an item that can contain another item inside (let's call it <i>innerStack</i>), and should
	 * respond to queries for that item, would work like this:<br>
	 * 
	 * <pre>return search.namesMatch(innerStack, query);</pre>

	 * Given an item which can have an operation mode String (let's call it <i>mode</i>), it would work like this:<br>
	 * 
	 * <pre>return matcher.matches(mode.trim().toLowerCase(), query);</pre>
	 * 
	 * @return false if the item should be darkened, true otherwise
